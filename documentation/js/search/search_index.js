server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nPlatform Scalability\nTo add new components to the project, follow the current file structure:  \n\ncore: Do add new element to this module only if these are singleton. Make sure to not reference these elements mora than once.  \nshared:  From Angular docs.  \nDo create a feature module named SharedModule in a shared folder; for example, app/shared/shared.module.ts defines SharedModule.Do declare components, directives, and pipes in a shared module when those items will be re-used and referenced by the components declared in other feature modules.Do declare all components, directives, and pipes in the SharedModule.Do export all symbols from the SharedModule that other feature modules need to use.  \n\n\nfeatures: From Angular docs.  \nDo create an NgModule for all distinct features in an application; for example, a Heroes feature. All feature areas are in their own folder, with their own NgModule.Do place the feature module in the same named folder as the feature area; for example, in app/heroes.Do name the feature module file reflecting the name of the feature area and folder; for example, app/heroes/heroes.module.ts.Do name the feature module symbol reflecting the name of the feature area, folder, and file; for example, app/heroes/heroes.module.ts defines HeroesModule.\n\n\n\nTo add new Privileges and Permissions, do it following the current structure described in app\\src\\core\\models\\privileges.ts and add it to the app\\src\\assets\\admin\\privileges.json file.  \nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nPRECOS-FE Documentation\nRun compodoc -s to see the documentation for the PRECOS Frontend platform. To run it on a diferent port, add the -r [port] option to the aforementioned command.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.To get more help on the Compodoc auto-generated documentation go and check out the Compodoc Documentation page.This project has been made using the Angular Material material design library, to learn more about check the Angular Material documentation page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n
